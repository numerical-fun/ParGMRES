## Title

ParGMRES: A parallel linear solver

## Team member

- Yu-Lun Tsai (yulunt)
- Chih-Wei Chang (cchang3)

## Summary

We propose to implement a parallelized GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual
method), which is a commonly used solver for large sparse linear system, on
GPU-CPU heterogeneous platform.
