Project Report
======================

## Title

ParGMRES: A parallel linear solver

## Team member

- Yu-Lun Tsai (yulunt)
- Chih-Wei Chang (cchang3)

## Summary

short (no more than a paragraph) project summary. If applicable, the summary 
should list your project deliverables (including what you plan to show at the 
parallelism competition) and what machines they ran on.

## Background

Describe the algorithm, application, or system you parallelized in computer 
science terms. (Recall our discussion from the last day of class.) Figure(s) 
would be really useful here.

## Approach

Tell us how your implementation works. Your description should be sufficiently 
detailed to provide the course staff a basic understanding of your approach. 
Again, it might be very useful to include a figure here illustrating components 
of the system and/or their mapping to parallel hardware.
