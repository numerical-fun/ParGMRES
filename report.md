Project Report
======================

## Title

ParGMRES: A parallel linear solver

## Team member

- Yu-Lun Tsai (yulunt)
- Chih-Wei Chang (cchang3)

## Summary

short (no more than a paragraph) project summary. If applicable, the summary 
should list your project deliverables (including what you plan to show at the 
parallelism competition) and what machines they ran on.

## Background

Describe the algorithm, application, or system you parallelized in computer 
science terms. (Recall our discussion from the last day of class.) Figure(s) 
would be really useful here.

## Approach

Tell us how your implementation works. Your description should be sufficiently 
detailed to provide the course staff a basic understanding of your approach. 
Again, it might be very useful to include a figure here illustrating components 
of the system and/or their mapping to parallel hardware.

## Result

How successful were you at achieving your goals? We expect results sections to 
differ from project to project, but we expect your evaluation to be very 
thorough (your project evaluation is a great way to demonstrate you understood 
topics from this course).

## References

Please provide a list of references used in the project.
